/**
 * Working with asynchronous functions:
 * setTimeout() is an asynchronous function, meaning that the timer function will not pause execution of other functions in the
 * functions stack. In other words, you cannot use setTimeout() to create a "pause" before the next function in the function stack fires.
 * See the following example:
 */

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("this is the first message");
}, 5000);
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("this is the second message");
}, 3000);
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("this is the third message");
}, 1000);

// Output:

// this is the third message
// this is the second message
// this is the first message

/**
 * Notice that the first function does not create a 5-second "pause" before calling the second function. Instead, the first function is called, but waits
 * 5 seconds to execute. While the first function is waiting to execute, the second function is called, and a 3-second wait is applied to the second function
 * before it executes. Since neither the first nor the second function's timers have completed, the third function is called and completes its execution first.
 * Then the second follows. Then finally the first function is executed after its timer finally completes.
 * --To create a progression in which one function only fires after the completion of another function, see the documentation on 'Promises'.
