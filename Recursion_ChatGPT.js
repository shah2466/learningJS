// Recursion is a powerful programming technique in which a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that triggers the function to stop calling itself.
// In JavaScript, recursion can be used to solve problems that have a recursive structure, such as traversing trees, searching through linked lists, and many 
// other algorithms. Here's a basic example of a recursive function in JavaScript that computes the factorial of a number:

function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n-1);
  }
}
// In this example, the factorial function takes an argument n and checks if it's equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1 (the base case). If n is not 0, 
// it recursively calls itself with n-1 as the argument, and multiplies the result of that call by n.
// When you call factorial(4), for example, the function calls itself four times:

factorial(4)
  factorial(3)
    factorial(2)
      factorial(1)
        factorial(0)
// At this point, the base case is triggered and the function starts returning values back up the call stack:

factorial(0) returns 1 //factorial(0)
factorial(1) returns 1 * 1 = 1 //1* factorial(0)
factorial(2) returns 2 * 1 = 2 //2*factorial(2-1)
factorial(3) returns 3 * 2 = 6 //3*factorial(3-1)
factorial(4) returns 4 * 6 = 24 //4*factorial(4-1). Factorial(3) = 6
//And the final result is 24, the factorial of 4.

// It's important to note that recursive functions can be very powerful, but they can also be inefficient if not implemented properly. 
// It's important to carefully consider the base case and ensure that the function is not calling itself excessively or unnecessarily.
