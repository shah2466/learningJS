Equality comparisons and sameness
JavaScript provides three different value-comparison operations:

=== — strict equality (triple equals)
== — loose equality (double equals)
Object.is()
Which operation you choose depends on what sort of comparison you are looking to perform. Briefly:

Double equals (==) will perform a type conversion when comparing two things, and will handle NaN, -0, and +0 specially to conform to IEEE 754 (so NaN != NaN, and -0 == +0);
Triple equals (===) will do the same comparison as double equals (including the special handling for NaN, -0, and +0) but without type conversion; if the types differ, false is returned.
Object.is() does no type conversion and no special handling for NaN, -0, and +0 (giving it the same behavior as === except on those special numeric values).
