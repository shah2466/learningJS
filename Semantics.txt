In JavaScript, "semantic" generally refers to the meaning of code or programming constructs rather than their syntax or structure.

For example, when you write a variable name like "totalPrice", the word "totalPrice" has semantic meaning because it communicates that the variable is storing a value that represents a total price.

Similarly, HTML elements have semantic meaning when they are used to convey information about the content they contain. For example, using the <header> tag in HTML to wrap the top portion of a web page is semantically meaningful because it communicates that this section is the header of the page.

In JavaScript, writing semantically meaningful code can make it easier for others to read and understand your code, and can also help you to write more maintainable and extensible programs.
