/**
 * Difference for..in and for..of:
Both for..in and for..of are looping constructs which are used to iterate over data structures. The only difference between them is the entities they iterate over:

for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object.
The for...in loop will traverse all integer keys before traversing other keys, and in strictly increasing order, making the behavior 
of for...in close to normal array iteration. However, the for...in loop will return all enumerable properties, including those with nonâ€“integer names and 
those that are inherited.

for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object. Examples of iterable objects are arrays, strings, and NodeLists.
The values which an iterable data structure will return using for..of is dependent on the type of iterable object. 
For example an array will return the values of all the array elements whereas a string returns every individual character of the string
