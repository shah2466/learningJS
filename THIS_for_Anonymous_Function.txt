In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the object that the function is bound to. The value of this depends on how the function is called.

When an anonymous function is called, the this keyword is bound to the global object (window in a web browser or global in Node.js) by default. This is because the anonymous function is not bound to any particular object.

However, the this binding for anonymous functions can be changed using one of the following techniques:

Using the bind method: The bind method creates a new function that is bound to a specific object. The first argument passed to bind sets the value of this inside the function.

Using the call or apply methods: These methods invoke a function with a specific this value. The first argument passed to call or apply sets the value of this inside the function.

Using an arrow function: Arrow functions do not have their own this binding, so they inherit the this value from their lexical scope. This means that the this value inside an arrow function is the same as the this value outside the function.

It's important to note that the this keyword can be tricky to understand in JavaScript, and it often requires careful consideration of the context in which a function is called to determine its value.
